# Wine Quality Predictive Modelüç∑·Åä·Åä||·Åä
In this project, I tested and evaluated several different Machine Learning models in an attempt to successfully estimate the quality score (1-10) of any specific type of wine

# Key Results
* KNN Regressor (26.03% Improvement over baseline)
* Decision Trees (23.45% Improvement over baseline)
* Linear Regression (16.39% Improvement over baseline)
# Future Improvements
- **Model Complexity**: I would like to implement more advanced models to hopefully capture patterns and trends better, such as Random Forest or XGBoost
- **Cross-Validation**: Utilize k-fold validation
- **Feature Engineering**: I believe that adding interaction terms or polynomial features could improve the complexity of this model and lead to better performance
