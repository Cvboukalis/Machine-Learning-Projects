# 「 Machine Learning Projects  」
This repository contains a showcase of my personal machine learning projects, created to improve my understanding and skills in predictive modeling and supervised learning, while exploring different algorithms and datasets. 
# 📊Project List 
- **[Wine Quality Prediction Model](https://github.com/Cvboukalis/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Model)**: Predictive regression model using Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Regression to predict wine quality based on chemical data. 
- **[Cancer Classification Model](https://github.com/Cvboukalis/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Cancer%20Classification%20Model)**: High-dimensional data classifier using feature selection and logistic regression to predict cancer type from ~4,000 gene features.
- **[Property Value Estimator](https://github.com/Cvboukalis/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction%20Model)**: Predictive regression model using multiple machine learning algorithms to estimate residential property market value and generate a high-accuracy price range
